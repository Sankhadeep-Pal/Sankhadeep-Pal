# Hi, I'm Sankhadeep! 👋
‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ ‎ 
## 🚀 About Me
I am a 1st Year B.Tech CSE student at Aliah University, New Town. While I might be early in my journey, I am a **hardcore worker** dedicated to mastering the art of software engineering. I don't believe in shortcuts—only in consistent, daily effort to bridge the gap between "beginner" and "expert."

- 🛠️ **Current Focus:** Deep-diving into the MERN Stack and mastering Data Structures & Algorithms.
- 💡 **Philosophy:** "Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard." I'm here to outwork the challenges.
- 🎯 **Goal:** To become a Super Software Engineer by building high-impact, open-source projects.
